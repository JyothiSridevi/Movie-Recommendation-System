# Movie-Recommendation-System
  The movie recommendation system you're developing is designed to suggest movies to users based on their mood and previously watched films.The main purpose of this recommendation system is to enhance the user experience by recommending movies that match a user's current mood, as well as considering their watching history and preferences. This system aims to be a convenient tool for discovering new movies in a way that feels personalized.
  The system uses the Apriori Algorithm and association-based learning to generate movie recommendations. The Apriori Algorithm helps identify relationships between different movies that users watch, essentially uncovering patterns like "users who watched movie A also watched movie B."
This recommendation system provides an enriched movie discovery experience by blending user moods with established preferences.
